    "# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Laboratory](Images/Laboratory.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that \n",
    "  science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., \n",
    "  a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. \n",
    "  In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), \n",
    "  a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. \n",
    "  In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. \n",
    "  Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the \n",
    "  performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. \n",
    "  You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of \n",
    "  the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "  Your tasks are to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before beginning the analysis, check the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data \n",
    "  associated with that mouse ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the cleaned data for the remaining steps.\n",
    "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
    "* Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the \n",
    "  tumor volume for each drug regimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows  the number of \n",
    "  total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **NOTE:** These plots should look identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the distribution \n",
    "  of female or male mice in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **NOTE:** These plots should look identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin,\n",
    "  Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any\n",
    "  potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and \n",
    "  highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Hint**: All four box plots should be within the same figure. Use this \n",
    "  [Matplotlib documentation page](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/pyplots/boxplot_demo_pyplot.html\n",
    "  #sphx-glr-gallery-pyplots-boxplot-demo-pyplot-py) for help with changing the style of the outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for \n",
    "                                  that mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume \n",
    "  for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that \n",
    "  can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some final considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must use proper labeling of your plots, to include properties such as: plot titles, axis labels, \n",
    "  legend labels, _x_-axis and _y_-axis limits, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* See the [starter workbook](Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb) for help on what modules \n",
    "  to import and expected format of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be warned: These are very challenging tasks. Be patient with yourself as you trudge through these problems. \n",
    "  They will take time and there is no shame in fumbling along the way. Data visualization is equal parts \n",
    "  exploration, equal parts resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have been provided a starter notebook. Use the code comments as a reminder of steps to follow as you complete \n",
    "  the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't get bogged down in small details. Always focus on the big picture. If you can't figure out how to get a \n",
    "  label to show up correctly, come back to it. Focus on getting the core skeleton of your notebook complete. You can always revisit old problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While you are trying to complete this assignment, feel encouraged to constantly refer to Stack Overflow and the \n",
    "  Pandas documentation. These are needed tools in every data analyst's tool belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember, there are many ways to approach a data problem. The key is to break up your task into micro tasks. \n",
    "  \n",
    "    Try answering questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How does my DataFrame need to be structured for me to have the right _x_-axis and _y_-axis?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How do I build a basic scatter plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How do I add a label to that scatter plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Where would the labels for that scatter plot come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Again, don't let the magnitude of a programming task scare you off. Ultimately, every programming problem boils down to a handful of bite-sized tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get help when you need it! There is never any shame in asking. But, as always, ask a _specific_ question. You'll never get a great answer to \"I'm lost.\"\n",
